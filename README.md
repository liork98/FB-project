"The Face-Book" is a web-based social network that provides a platform for registered members to interact with their friends online. 
When a user signs up, they create a unique profile with their name and date of birth. This information is stored in a database.

Once registered, each member has their own notice board where they can post statuses. A status can contain text, an image, or a video. The system records the date and time of each status, and it cannot be modified once posted. 

In addition to posting their own statuses, members can also add friends to their network. Once a friend is added, the friendship is mutual and no approval is required from the other side. The system keeps track of all friends for each member.

Members can also follow fan pages, which are business pages. Each page has a unique name, and users can add them to their list of interesting entities. 
Each fan page has a list of all the members who follow it. (a member's name and a fan page's name can be the same, but they will have different profiles and statuses.)

For each member, the system displays the 10 most recent and updated statuses of their friends.
The system also provides fan pages with their own notice board where they can post statuses.

- _All project names is case-sensitive._
- _In every disconnection (choosing the 'exit' option), the data is saved to a `recent_run_data.txt` file. The program will retrieve the information from this file for the next run._

Enjoy (:
